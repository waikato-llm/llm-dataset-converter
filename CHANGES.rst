0.1.0 (2024-02-05)
------------------

- fixed output format of `to-llama2-format` filter
- `llama2-to-pairs` filter has more robust parsing now

0.0.5 (2024-01-24)
------------------

- added flag `-b/--force_batch` to the `llm-convert` tool which all data to be reader from the
  reader before filtering it and then passing it to the writer; useful for batch filters.
- added the `randomize-records` batch filter
- added the `--encoding ENC` option to file readers
- auto-determined encoding is now being logged (`INFO` level)
- the `LDC_ENCODING_MAX_CHECK_LENGTH` environment variable allows overriding the default
  number of bytes used for determining the file encoding in auto-detect mode

- added method `replace_extension` to `base_io` module for changing a files extension
  (removes any supported compression suffix first)
- stream writers (.jsonl/.txt) now work with `--force_batch` mode; the output file name
  gets automatically generated from the input file name when just using a directory for
  the output


0.0.4 (2023-12-19)
------------------

- `pairs-to-llama2` filter now has an optional `--prefix` parameter to use with the instruction
- added the `pretrain-sentences-to-pairs` filter for generating artificial prompt/response datasets from pretrain data
- requires seppl>=0.0.11 now
- the `LDC_MODULES_EXCL` environment variable is now used for specifying modules to be excluded from the registration
  process (e.g., used when generating help screens for derived libraries that shouldn't output the
  base plugins as well)
- `llm-registry` and `llm-help` now allow specifying excluded modules via `-e/--excluded_modules` option

  processed is being output in the console (default: 1000)
- `text-length` filter now handles None values, i.e., ignores them
- locations (i.e., input/instructions/output/etc) can be specified now multiple times
- the `llm-help` tool can generate index files for all the plugins now; in case of markdown
  it will link to the other markdown files


0.0.3 (2023-11-10)
------------------

- added the `record-window` filter
- added the `llm-registry` tool for querying the registry from the command-line

- added the `replace-patterns` filter
- added `-p/--pretty-print` flag to `to-alpaca` writer
- added `pairs-to-llama2` and `llama2-to-pairs` filter
  (since llama2 has instruction as part of the string, it is treated as pretrain data)
- added `to-llama2-format` filter for pretrain records (no [INST]...[/INST] block)
- now requiring seppl>=0.0.8 in order to raise Exceptions when encountering unknown arguments


0.0.2 (2023-10-31)
------------------

- added `text-stats` filter

- `text_utils.apply_max_length` now uses simple whitespace splitting instead of
  searching for nearest word boundary to break a line, which results in a massive
  speed improvement
- fix: `text_utils.remove_patterns` no longer multiplies the generated lines when using
  more than one pattern
- added `remove-patterns` filter
- pretrain and translation text writers now buffer records by default (`-b`, `--buffer_size`)
  in order to improve throughput
- jsonlines writers for pair, pretrain and translation data are now stream writers

------------------

- initial release
